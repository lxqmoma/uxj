This article will explain how to make money in China in the current environment.

It is recommended to **translate this page into Chinese** before reading.

## Necessary & Important

You need to meet the following conditions to start your money-making journey:

- You can access the internet freely and visit websites like [google.com](https://google.com/).
- You are able to use [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) normally.
- You can use exchanges like [Binance](https://www.maxweb.red/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_00372TCM6H&utm_source=default), [HTX](https://www.htx.com/zh-cn), and [OKX](https://www.okx.com/zh-hans/download), or you have your own digital wallet.
- You want to make money.

## Electricity bill & Phone bill

We all know that monthly electricity and phone bills are very high. However, these costs are actually virtual; the cost of 100 yuan worth of electricity might only be 80 yuan. So, if you don't want to pay 100 yuan for 100 yuan worth of electricity, I have a way to tell you [**how to pay 80 yuan for 100 yuan worth of electricity**](https://uxj.app/pages/login/register?invitation=85FTCH).


## Credit cards & Online loans

Credit cards, online loans, JD.com's BaiTiao (a consumer credit service), Du Xiaoman (a consumer credit service), Ant Financial's Huabei (a consumer credit service), and many other products all offer low-discount repayment options. For example, I can repay at a 25% discount, meaning I can repay 10,000 yuan with only 7,500 yuan, effectively earning 2,500 yuan. This return of over 25% is more than enough to offset many cryptocurrency and stock market fund investments.

## More

## Summary

You can clearly see that everything I mentioned above includes website links. That's right, the website links are the discounted recharge platforms I introduced.
