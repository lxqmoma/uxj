However, these costs are actually virtual; the cost of 100 yuan worth of electricity might only be 80 yuan. So, if you don&#39;t want to pay 100 yuan for 100 yuan worth of electricity, I have a way to tell you <a href="https://uxj.app/pages/login/register?invitation=85FTCH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>how to pay 80 yuan for 100 yuan worth of electricity</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="credit-cards-online-loans" tabindex="-1">Credit cards &amp; Online loans <a class="header-anchor" href="#credit-cards-online-loans" aria-label="Permalink to “Credit cards &amp; Online loans”">​</a></h2><p>Credit cards, online loans, JD.com&#39;s BaiTiao (a consumer credit service), Du Xiaoman (a consumer credit service), Ant Financial&#39;s Huabei (a consumer credit service), and many other products all offer low-discount repayment options. For example, I can repay at a 25% discount, meaning I can repay 10,000 yuan with only 7,500 yuan, effectively earning 2,500 yuan. This return of over 25% is more than enough to offset many cryptocurrency and stock market fund investments.</p><h2 id="more" tabindex="-1">More <a class="header-anchor" href="#more" aria-label="Permalink to “More”">​</a></h2><p>Of course, in addition to the electricity bill, phone bill, credit card, and online loan products mentioned above, you will find many other ways to make money after logging into the platform.</p><p>Why not click my referral link now and start making money with me?</p><h2 id="tutorial" tabindex="-1">Tutorial <a class="header-anchor" href="#tutorial" aria-label="Permalink to “Tutorial”">​</a></h2><p>The platform has an <a href="http://38.181.24.144:10086/doc/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official tutorial</a>; after reading it, you&#39;ll naturally understand how to operate it.
